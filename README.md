LINEAR REGRESSION
Linear Regression is a powerful statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is one of the most widely used techniques in the field of machine learning, data science, and statistics.

At its core, Linear Regression helps you to understand how a change in one variable affects the other. With its simplicity and versatility, Linear Regression has become an essential tool in predicting and forecasting various real-world problems such as stock prices, weather patterns, sales trends, and more.

In this repository, you will find everything you need to know about Linear Regression - from its basic concepts to advanced techniques. You will learn how to build, train, and evaluate Linear Regression models using Python, R, or any programming language of your choice.

Whether you are a beginner or an expert, this repository is your ultimate guide to mastering Linear Regression. So, buckle up and get ready to dive into the exciting world of Linear Regression!

RANDOM FOREST
under random forest classification i have been able to first load the dataset that i was using and be able to break a few attributed like age separately and dropped off some columns which were not needed, i then splitted the data into both testing and training sets so that i could be able to measure its accuracy.
i used both entropy and gini index so that i could see the difference it terms of their accuracy.

RESULTS
i found out that there was a slight variation in the accuracy.
for entropy, i found an accuracy of 95% while for gini i found an accuracy of 94%
